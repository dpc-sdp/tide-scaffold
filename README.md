# Tide Scaffold

Tide Scaffold is (aspirationally) an installation (Composer) manifest and lock 
for a [ Tide ](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide) installation generated from the corresponding version of 
reference-tide-vic-gov-au

The current manifest has been manually generated from the Drupal 9 WIP of 
[ reference-sdp ](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/reference-sdp-vic-gov-au/pull/39)

## Roadmap
* Automatic version updates
  Push updates to the manifest from reference-sdp 
  after a successful build.
